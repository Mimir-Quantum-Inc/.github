# Mimir Quantum, Inc.

Welcome to *Mimir Quantum, Inc.*, a pioneer in the EdTech industry, designing and delivering cutting-edge educational enrichment services powered by generative AI. As a tech startup that dwells at the intersection of technology, education, and innovation, we are reshaping the traditional education landscape by leveraging the power of AI.

## What We Do

Mimir Quantum, Inc. operates a cloud-based SaaS platform, providing a two-sided, interconnected platform that caters to both the educators and the students. 

On one side of the platform, we're building an advanced AI-driven tutoring and assistance tool. This tool is optimized by robust models that are constructed from high-quality datasets weâ€™ve gathered through our partnerships with licensed educators and learning institutions. The tool is designed like a natural conversation platform where students can engage with the AI through text and even audio input/output, mimicking an online chat interface. This allows for a more personalized, intuitive, and natural interaction that enhances the student's learning experience.

On the other side, we're building a comprehensive administration portal that serves educators, school administrators, and parents alike. It's a space where they can shape, manage, and evolve a centralized learning experience tailored to the needs and interests of their students/children. This portal empowers them with tools to craft immersive digital learning experiences that will prepare the next generation for the future.
